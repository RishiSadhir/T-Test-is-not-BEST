In this repository, we explore the task of comparing groups of measurements. Everyone knows about the T-Test and everyone uses it. Yet, there are better methods for drawing inferences from two independent groups’ metric data (Kruschke, 2013; Morey & Rouder, 2015). Let’s talk about how “Bayesian estimation supersedes the t-test” (Kruschke, 2013).

Kruschke (2013, p.573) writes:

    “When data are interpreted in terms of meaningful parameters in a mathematical description, such as the difference of mean parameters in two groups, it is Bayesian analysis that provides complete information about the credible parameter values. Bayesian analysis is also more intuitive than traditional methods of null hypothesis significance testing (e.g., Dienes, 2011).”

In that article (Bayesian estimation supersedes the t-test) Kruschke (2013) provided clear and well-reasoned arguments favoring Bayesian parameter estimation over null hypothesis significance testing in the context of comparing two groups, a situation which is usually dealt with a t-test. It also introduced a robust model for comparing two groups, which modeled the data as t-distributed, instead of a Gaussian distribution.

In this repository, we use STAN to encode this model generally in the file `BEST.stan` and a notebook is provided that shows its use in comparing action move ratings versus comedy movie ratings.
